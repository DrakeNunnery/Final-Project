     These sources I picked gave me direct information from domestic abuse places in teh state of kentucky that reported their numbers for a year straight. This give am accurate representation of reported domestic abuse cases in the state of kentucky. These clinics reported accurate and up to date numbers with a varirty of categroies such as age classifications, gender, and race. I made charts of each of these then found drinking percentages in the same year for men vs. women. These are my visuals I provided.
