  Domestic violence is a problem that seems to surface only on occasion in our country. I think that finding information behind the United States domestic violence numbers will help bring a light to the subject. People have a grasp on how awful the situation is, but I don't feel they understand the rapid increase in numbers that we are expirencing, along with how many people's future lives are changed from this. Maybe the numbers will shock people into not denying that this is a huge problem throughout our country.
